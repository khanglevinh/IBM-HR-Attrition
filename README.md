# IBM-HR-Attrition  
**Insights**
-  Four factors that have a significant impact on employee attrition are: Overtime, Monthly Income, Work Satisfaction, Distance from Home and Business Travel.  
 
 -  Single groups have a higher attrition rate compared to the other two groups. This is due to the very low levels of environment satisfaction and job satisfaction among the single group.  

 -  Employees who work overtime have a higher attrition rate because they struggle to balance their work and personal life. Factors such as years since last promotion do not have much impact on them.  

 -  Employees in the Research & Development department have a higher attrition rate due to long hours, lower salaries, and low job satisfaction, compared to the Sales and HR departments.  

-  Employees with outstanding performance have a much higher rate of overtime compared to those with excellent performance. Therefore, their work satisfaction is also lower, and they are more frequently required to travel for work.

Enhance Job Satisfaction:  
-  Improve employee benefits and support, especially in departments with low satisfaction.
